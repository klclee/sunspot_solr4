= Sunspot::Solr

Sunspot::Solr is a packaged distribution of Solr for use with the
Sunspot[http://outoftime.github.com/sunspot] and
Sunspot::Rails[https://github.com/outoftime/sunspot/tree/master/sunspot_rails]
gems.  See those gems' documentation for more information.

Note: You will see that Sunspot[http://outoftime.github.com/sunspot] also have this, but I duplicated this as I have forked it and updated to solr 4. But since the gem was embeded in sunspot I couldn't figure out how to pull it right from my Gemfile. If you do drop me a note.

Note2: To run this the rake tasks name changed from solr to solr4 e.g. rake sunspot:solr4:run
